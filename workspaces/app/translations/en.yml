      <b>Taskbar icons doesn't match a newly created Web App.</b>
      The desktop can be slow with updating and matching a newly created Web App. Restart the Web App and it will match with the correct icon.

      <b>Setup browser with isolated profile</b>
      For Chromium based browsers, right click the title bar and select "Open browser window" or press &lt;Ctrl+T&gt;.

      For Firefox based browsers press &lt;Alt&gt;. Go to `View` and enable `Menu Bar`. This should set Firefox to a somewhat normal mode with menu elements. Disable the `Menu bar` to remove the ui elements again.

      For the Zen browser press &lt;Alt+Ctrl+C&gt;.

      This can be used to setup the browser inside the isolated profile and install extensions.

      <b>Uninstall</b>
      Uninstalling this app does <b>not</b> remove created Web Apps. Removing this applications app data will remove the icons and isolation profiles of system browsers but Web Apps may still popup on your desktop. To remove all data, delete all Web Apps before deleting this application. This will ensure everything is removed.
  permissions:
    title: Permissions
    text_pango: |
      <b>filesystem=xdg-data/applications:create</b>
      Used to create new Web Applications. Usually resolves to ~/.local/share/applications.

      <b>filesystem=~/.var/app:create</b>
      Used to create isolated profiles for flatpak browsers. For some flatpak browsers it's necessary to create a directory in their sandbox for profile isolation. Also firefox browsers need an updated profile to create a minimal ui. The browser cannot break out of it's own filesystem so this application needs to break in.

      For example the Firefox based browsers don't create the isolated profile directory and will fail when the directory doesn't exist.

      System installed browsers isolated profiles are saved in our own xdg-data/profiles directory.

      <b>filesystem=xdg-data/flatpak/app:ro &amp; filesystem=/var/lib/flatpak/app:ro</b>
      Used to fetch the icons of the flatpak browsers.

      <b>talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak</b>
      Used to run commands outside of the sandbox. This is needed to fetch flatpak browser information and to run the created Web App from this application.

        This will reset the config files (e.g.: browser configs).
        It will not remove your create web apps.
